Answer:
Yes. Anyone, anywhere in the world can make use of the internet to better his or her life. Educational opportunities are now accessible, job openings, joint ventures, Grant access, intership and even immigration opportunities are all possible today.

On the negative side, hackers, scamers are using the internet to broaden their nefarous skills. Terrorists and extremists are using the dark web to Forster their collaborations across borders etc.

The more education accessible to the world populace the better world will become.

This all changed and now most websites advertise, even YouTube embed  ads in the middle of a video. Cyber attacks and hacking is a daily event. Spam emails, unwelcome cookies, adware, spyware and virus/worms infest the Internet. Websites are attacked and taken down or worse. I was even infected with ransom ware where all my Microsoft files were encrypted. So I had no access to music and photographs. I used Netscape navigator as my browser before the war of the browsers began.
Now Google have a near monopoly on the web, their search engine can show webpages if they choose not to censor them. They show results according to their interests. The big tech companies pay very little in tax and companies like Amazon while very popular can destroy the business in small countries.

Many thanks for taking the time to assist - I really appreciate it.  Unfortunately however I still cannot find the icon to enable me to select My Trinkets and create a new trinket.  In my Trinket from the last exercise I have two icons in the top right hand corner: one is the REMIX icon, and when I select the icon immediately to the right of it this merely gives the options of SIGN IN, PASSWORD, LOG IN or CREATE ACCOUNT.  There is no NEW TRINKET button.  I looked at your Trinket from the last exercise and this is no different from mine.  I tried to get an answer from Support but they do not deal with individual course issues.  I would describe myself as above average for computer literacy and had no problems with the first couple of exercises but this has really got me stumped.  I wonder what I've missed?  I wonder how many other learners have experienced this same problem and whether the course authors are going to address it before people start to pull their hair out in frustration and decide to leave the course.  Anyway, once again thanks for trying to assist.",2020-01-08 16:20:02 UTC,0,,,,

Help! I'm unable to continue with section 1.6 Displaying Information In HTML as I am unable to find the blue button with the label ""New Trinket"" on the web page or anywhere else for that matter. David Cook experienced a similar problem and advised how he overcame it (see our correspondence below) - unfortunately the solution to his problem did not work with mine.  It is very frustrating when one puts aside time to devote to the course only to run up against a metaphorical brick wall.  What have I missed please?

- I'd like to ""change my stars"" so to speak, and give myself a chance to learn something I love (design) and situate myself in a place where I am not living paycheck to paycheck, but instead expanding my skills while securing my future.

What are you hoping to learn?
- The basics of HTML and CSS so that I can not only understand how to code my designs, but I can utilize UX design tools and understand the ""manual version"" of how design works. 

What steps will you take to ensure that you will complete the course, for example by setting aside some ‘do not disturb’ time in your schedule each week, or by inviting a colleague to take it with you?
- I am giving myself set times to work on my studies by breaking up my day in chunks to assure I get my day-to-day tasks complete and proactively make time to learn and use new tools. ",2020-01-09 01:50:49 UTC,0,,,,

Thanks for coming across this & after some searching I've come up with this:

In your 'validate.html' can you please try the following line instead:

<form name=""myForm"" onsubmit=""validateForm()"" action=""index.html"">

This deletes the 'method=""post""' entry which is trying to contact a web page that isn't defined.

The 'action=""index.html""' takes you to that page after the 'submit' - delete this entry if you want to stay on the page.

Hope this is of some help.

As you are an artist I am sure you will want to learn the hexadecimal way of attributing colours to your web pages. They work in 3 pairs and always begin with #. They are ordered like this: Red Green Blue and work on a counting system from 0 to 15 (base 16); 0123456789ABCDEF. You can also use lower-case letters. #000000 would be no colour, not even white. #FFFFFF would be white. There are different colours in between 'no colour' and 'white'. It is extremely varied.
#FF0000 would be a very bright red. #FF4444 would be a darker red, because it has maximum Red, some Green, and some Blue.
Whenever pairs are identical FF 44 44 you can abbreviate them like this #F44. This is the same as #FF4444.
W3C will help. 

It works like this: color:#FF4444 or color=""#FF4444""

The title is likely to be produced only once on a web page and the author may not want to repeat the same styling across the web site.
There are multiple uses of the <H2></H2> throughout the web page. It is convenient to not have to repeat identical attributes throughout the HTML. At least that is the current thinking. Personally, I am quite happy to cut and paste  attributes.
However, by using a style sheet the layout of the HTML and its attributes are much less likely to be copied. The HTML can be accessed / seen and copied. Try this:  Right click your mouse on this page. Scroll down the menu to 'View Page Source' and click on it. The HTML appears on a new tab. Scroll down to line 287.

Cascade Style Sheets (CSS) are so, so important in styling web pages because CSS, particularly CSS3 (current version of CSS language) is so versatile in giving the web page author a huge amount of control in how a web page is shown. I think that it is really important to understand how a class, id, and selector works. 
 
I have made web sites that worked quite well. but I am untidy with combining what I want to say on web pages, displaying the web site as I want it to, placing CSS controlled influences, and fully participating with the most effective way of doing so. 

I can get around some layout problems, but never enough, because I need to really, really learn this part of the course and make sure I use it in my web pages.

If you click on my Trinket page you will see that I am not changing mistakes. Instead, I leave bad ways of applying CSS styling, as well as good, that could be improved on.",2020-01-15 20:14:23 UTC,0,,,,

I like using pop-up windows that I can easily close and continue with what I was looking at for things such as checking words, or small facts.. whereas I would prefer a new tab if I am after some new information that I want to continue pursuing, as well as stay in the initial website. I only go navigating to new page and leaving initial website if I don't intent to go back there, either on the day or because I have run out of interest, etc.
And, sometimes, I like to work with a few windows open - as well as separate tabs within them - if I am working on different issues during the same period.
WOW, I have just surprised myself with how much I know about my own preferences 

How would we go about letting our user/visitor make their choice when navigating around our links? Is it possible to do this with HMTL?

'p.city' should be used for all <p>'s in a page that have the class 'city'.

But '.city p' is used for all <p>'s that are inside a section, or a <div>, of the page, the section being of class 'city'. These <p>'s inside the section won't be of class 'city'.

So:

<body>

<p class=""city"">This has 'p.city' styling<p>

<div class=""city"">
<p>This has '.city p' styling<p>
</div>

<p class=""city"">This also has 'p.city' styling<p>

</body>

Maybe this helps ? Or maybe not ...

Cheers,
Tim.",2020-01-30 04:46:49 UTC,1,,,,

1). When you want to keep hierarchy of a website clearly and prefer to present information clearly. 

2).  You don't want a user of your website to keep on pressing 'Back' button after clicking few links. When a user clicks a link, if it opens in a same tab; then user won't be able to see the home page. After few clicks, a user will struggle to remember and navigation and it will be very confusing. By allowing links to open in a new tab will definitely solve this problem.

You used a class to style the cities because you wanted to reuse the class for different cities. Also, if you want to add more features, you should be able to do it by combining different classes. 
However, you used  an id to style the title of the page because you wanted to have the SAME look and feel to all pages on a website.

Now, whether the information shared is valid and relevant, that this of course another story. An aspect of the internet ethos which I believe is not respected is privacy. 

With regards to the second question about big internet companies and whether they control too much of the web, I think that even though big companies have access to certain areas of the internet unknown to common people, and certain companies use personal searches and other information to control the economy and the market, it is impossible to have a complete control of what there is in the web.

1. I am having problems with this. I cant get the the js code to work in my style.js folder only in the HTML bit. (I have got the name entry and my question 3 to validate by putting the code in the HTML and it works.)
2. I tried to put in the radio button validation as above and cant get it to work, but I have managed to get it to validate slightly differently.
3. Is there another full example of the validation for my question 2 as I can't seem to get this to go either?

I haven't put in a total points button code in HTML yet as need to sort out validation first.

Notice the h2 class is only applied to the first two cities: <h2 class=""city"">London</h2>; while the last two cities are simply: <h2>Tokyo</h2>. 

In order for the other h2 elements to change, you need to insert the class rule. I.e. The HTML should read <h2 class=""city"">city name</h2>, then anything you assign to the class will be styled that way.

Also, I would recommend to do the following two things which helped a lot:

1) Comment out any new code or existing code which is not working or responding instead of deleting everything. Specially in JavaScript, use comments to disable few functions and then check them one by one. 

HTML comments: <!--    your code -->
JavaScript: /* your code */
CSS: /* your code */

2) Use W3schools website (https://www.w3schools.com) to recall any syntax or rules.
